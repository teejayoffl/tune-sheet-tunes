    {
      "question": "What happens if I file my annual accounts late?",
      "answer": "Late filing results in automatic penalties from Companies House ranging from £150 to £1,500, depending on how late the accounts are filed. These penalties double for repeat offences. Additionally, persistent late filing can lead to director disqualification and damage to your company's credit rating."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I change my accounting reference date (ARD)?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can change your ARD by filing form AA01 with Companies House. You can extend your accounting period once every 5 years by up to 18 months, or shorten it as many times as you like. Note that changing your ARD doesn't change your Corporation Tax accounting period."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do dormant companies need to file annual accounts?",
      "answer": "Yes, dormant companies must still file annual accounts, but they can file simplified 'dormant company accounts' (form AA02). A company is dormant if it has had no 'significant accounting transactions' during the accounting period, except for filing fees, penalties, and share subscriptions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between annual accounts and a tax return?",
      "answer": "Annual accounts are filed with Companies House and show your company's financial position to stakeholders. A Corporation Tax return (CT600) is filed with HMRC and calculates the tax your company owes. While they're based on the same financial data, they serve different purposes and have different deadlines."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need an accountant to prepare annual accounts?",
      "answer": "While not legally required for small companies, using a qualified accountant is highly recommended. They ensure compliance with accounting standards, maximize tax efficiency, and can represent you if HMRC or Companies House have queries. For medium and large companies requiring audits, you must use qualified professionals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I file abbreviated accounts?",
      "answer": "The option to file abbreviated accounts was removed in 2016. However, small companies can choose to file 'filleted' accounts, which exclude the profit and loss account and director's report from the public record. Full accounts must still be prepared for shareholders."
    },
    {
      "question": "What accounting standards should I follow?",
      "answer": "UK companies typically follow either FRS 102 (full Financial Reporting Standard) or FRS 105 (for micro-entities). FRS 105 is simpler but has restrictions, such as not allowing asset revaluations. Your choice depends on company size and complexity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long must I keep accounting records?",
      "answer": "Companies must keep accounting records for at least 6 years from the end of the financial year they relate to. HMRC can request records within this period for tax investigations. Some documents, like contracts or property records, should be kept longer."
